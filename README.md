### Hi guys, I'm OFShare, nice to meet you  👋

- "我曾经也有想过尽自己微薄的一点智力为这个我所热爱的学科, 为这个我所热爱的国家作出一点微小的贡献."

- "人生就像动态规划, 你的一个又一个阶段是由上天安排的, 而你, 决定的是在这一阶段可以由上一阶段的哪些状态转移而来, 越勤奋, 越幸运, 并不代表这一次你决策的方向有多么优秀, 却代表着现在的这一个状态能够续写多少可能的结果. "



- My dreams are

  - to live a long and happy life.
  - to practice the art of human rationality.
  -  to reach mastery in computer programming and use my expertise to make people’s lives more fulfilling.
